### Why another JavaScript framework?

When I first heard about node in 2011 I was really excited. Not because it was fast, efficient, or asynchonous, but because the idea of doing full stack development all in the same language was incredibly appealing. Even more than avoiding the cognitive shift that happens when I switch from my backend language of choice to JavaScript on the frontend, I was excited about the possibility of sharing code between these two previously separate entities. Along with these advantages, node promised an enjoyable package manager and plethora of well built modules that could be easily mixed and matched to best fit each unique development challenge.

Imagine my dissappointment when I realized that with the most popular node web development frameworks i still had to duplicate my views on the server and client. There was no good way to share code either. In fact, it seemed that most developers weren't using node for building web apps at all. Instead, it was mostly being used to build APIs.

Over the past four years  waited and hoped that someone would fill in the gaps that existed in tooling, libraries and frameworks for node web application development. The node landscape has gotten much better over the last four years. I researched and tested out a number of node web development frameworks during that time, including express, sails, strongloop, and meteor among others. Each eventually left me dissatisfied (although Sails came pretty close).
